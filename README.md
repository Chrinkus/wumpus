# Hunt the Wumpus

A text based adventure originally invented by Gregory Yob. This version is a solution to a problem from the following book:

> Stroustrup, Bjarne (2014) _Programming Principles and Practice Using C++_ (Chapter 18 Ex 12)

When initially confronted with this problem I did not possess the facilities to execute it satisfactorily. While I'm sure a minimal version was possible at the time, I grew frustrated when attempting to assemble the game components.

I have since completed the text and have wanted to come back to this exercise.
