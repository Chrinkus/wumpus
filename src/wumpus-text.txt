splash-title: Hunt the Wumpus
splash-story: Deep in a dark cave there lives a horrible, smelly Wumpus. This monster eats toys, steals snacks and sits on couches without wiping it's bum. You have entered his lair armed with only a bow and arrow. Your task: find and slay the beast.
hint-bat: You hear intermittent flapping noises..
hint-pit: You feel a damp breeze..
hint-wumpus: You smell the stinking Wumpus..
prompt-command: What is your command?
fail-move: That room is not connected to this one.
fail-shoot: You reach for an arrow but your quiver is empty.
result-miss-wake: You let an arrow fly and listen.. you hear it strike a wall. The sharp sound wakes the horrible Wumpus! The cave echoes as it lumbers to another room..
result-miss-death: YOU STARE IN HORROR AS THE AWFUL BEAST ENTERS YOUR ROOM!!
result-miss-sleep: ..and falls back asleep.
result-move-bat: A giant bat grabs you by the shoulder and takes off! The winged beast carries you a way and drops you into a room.
result-move-pit: As you step into the room you notice a giant pit before you. Instinctively you step back but the sudden movement causes the ground to crumble a little beneath your feet. You drop to the receding ground and claw desperately for something to save you. Nothing. You fall into the darkness and die alone.
result-move-wumpus:
result-hit-wumpus: As you loose your arrow into the darkness you hold your breath.. you are rewarded with the soft meaty-sound of a successful hit! The monster's death groan fills the cave!
